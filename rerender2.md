## 🧾 React `onClick` — Function Definition vs Function Call (Final Notes)

### ✅ Correct Usage — With Parameters

```jsx
<button onClick={() => setFlag(prev => !prev)}>Click Me</button>
```

* ✅ **React treats `() => setFlag(...)` as a function definition.**
* This arrow function **is stored** and executed **later** (when user clicks).
* It’s needed because we’re **passing a parameter** (`prev => !prev`), so we must **wrap it in a function**.

🧠 React's thinking:

> "This is a function to call when the user clicks. I'll save it."

---

### ❌ Wrong Usage — Immediate Call

```jsx
<button onClick={setFlag(prev => !prev)}>Click Me</button>
```

* ❌ **This is a function call**, not a function definition.
* `setFlag(...)` runs **immediately during rendering**, not on click.
* Causes **immediate state update** → triggers re-render → infinite loop → ❗**"Too many re-renders" error**.

🧠 React's thinking:

> "You're calling the function right now. I got the result (probably undefined). I'll store that result in `onClick`. But you've already changed state mid-render!"

---

### ⚠️ Special Case — No Parameters

```jsx
<button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>
```

* ✅ This is valid **because no parameters are passed**.
* `handleClick` is just a **function reference**, so it gets called only when clicked.
* Works just like the arrow function, but cleaner when no arguments are needed.

🧠 React's thinking:

> "Okay, you're giving me the function. I won’t run it now — just when needed."

### 🧠 Your Personal Rule (Well-Said!):

```js
// We have to use an arrow function here because we are passing a parameter.
// While passing a parameter, we **don't have a choice** — we can't just write:
// ❌ onClick={setFlag(prev)} — this is invalid and runs immediately.
//
// But this one is valid:
// ✅ onClick={handleClick} — because it has no parameters, it's safe to pass as a reference.

| Code                                     | Type React Sees     | Valid? | Explanation                                          |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `onClick={() => setFlag(prev => !prev)}` | Function definition | ✅ Yes  | Used when passing arguments — wrapped in a function. |
| `onClick={setFlag(prev => !prev)}`       | Function call       | ❌ No   | Runs immediately — causes infinite re-renders.       |
| `onClick={handleClick}`                  | Function reference  | ✅ Yes  | No parameters — safe to pass directly.               |
